# Level-Based Customer Persona Analysis

This project demonstrates a data-driven approach to understanding and segmenting a company's customer base using Python. By analyzing sales transactions and customer demographics, we aim to define level-based customer personas and estimate potential revenue from new customer segments.

## Business Problem

A game company seeks to refine its marketing and product development strategies by segmenting its customers into level-based personas. These personas are defined based on customer demographics and purchasing behavior. The goal is to predict the average revenue generated by new customers falling into these segments.

## Dataset Overview

The `Persona.csv` dataset contains transactional sales data from an international game company. Each record in the dataset represents a sale, including the price of the product sold and demographic information about the customer making the purchase. It is important to note that the dataset is not deduplicated, meaning the same customer may appear multiple times with multiple transactions.

### Columns

- `Price`: The amount spent by the customer.
- `Source`: The device type the customer used for the purchase.
- `Sex`: The customer's gender.
- `Country`: The customer's country.
- `Age`: The customer's age.

## Solution Approach

The analysis is carried out in two main versions:

### First Version

1. **Data Exploration**: Initial analysis involves understanding the dataset's structure, identifying unique values, and aggregating sales data.
2. **Customer Segmentation**: Customers are segmented based on country, source, sex, and age category. Each segment is labeled with a unique identifier combining these attributes.
3. **Revenue Estimation**: For each segment, the average revenue (price) is calculated. These averages help in predicting potential revenue from new or existing customer segments.
4. **Segmentation and Estimation**: Customers are further divided into quartiles based on their average spending, and potential revenue from new customer personas is estimated.

### Second Version

Refines the process by encapsulating logic in functions for better modularity and repeatability. It includes:
- A function for segmenting customers and calculating average revenue.
- A plotting function to visualize customer distribution across segments.
- The main function drives the analysis, from reading the dataset to making revenue predictions for specific new customer personas.

## Usage

To run this project, ensure you have pandas and matplotlib installed in your Python environment. Execute the script to perform the analysis and generate segmentation visualizations and revenue estimations for specified new customer personas.

## Results

The script outputs:
- A customer segmentation visual, showcasing the distribution of customers across segments.
- Estimated average revenue for specific new customer personas, aiding in strategic decision-making.
